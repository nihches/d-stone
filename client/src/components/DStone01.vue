                &ensp; Starting to write a story is really hard, that is why I
                always start in the middle, because I don’t mind how I write.
                But why do I write? That is the question that makes my brain
                tingle. It is not a pleasant thing to do, but I still do it.
            </p>
            <p>
                &ensp;I am searching for something, hidden deep in the
                unknown. And I have to find it, well at this point do I even
                have a choice? So much of it has already been written. 
            </p>
            <p>
                &ensp;I must finish it, even if I decided that I won’t do it.
                Who am I to decide that? The ending is already set in stone.
                I can’t escape it, none of us can.
            </p>
            <p>
                &ensp;Stories commonly begin in the beginning, but I would
                like to start even before that. Going to the beginning of our
                universe, our reality, won’t be enough. We have to start
                before that. 
            </p>
            <p>
                &ensp;We came from nothing and we will go back to nothing.
                That is the absolute end to our story.
